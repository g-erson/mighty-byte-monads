title: Permutations of three things
---

Our allPerms function is more general but it still only lets us generate
permutations of two things.  It is probably not not immediately obvious how to
extend your allPerms function to do that.  First implement an allPerms3
function that generates permutations of 3 things.  Don't try to do anything
fancy yet.  Just use the most straightforward approach you can think of.

    allPerms3 :: (a -> b -> c -> d) -> [a] -> [b] -> [c] -> [d]

Here is example output to check your function.

    allPerms3 (,,) [1,2] [3,4] [5,6] == [(1,3,5),(1,3,6),(1,4,5),(1,4,6),(2,3,5),(2,3,6),(2,4,5),(2,4,6)]
