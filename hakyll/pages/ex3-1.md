title: Generating permutations
---

Have you ever needed to generate all possible permutations of something?  In
imperative languages generating combinations and permutations always seemed
like a pain to me.  We are going to explore how Haskell can make permutation
generation easier.

First, write this function:

    allPairs :: [a] -> [b] -> [(a,b)]

This function should generate all possible pairs of items from each of the two
input lists.  This means it should NOT have this behavior:

    allPairs [1,2,3] [4,5,6] == [(1,4),(2,5),(3,6)]

That's the zip function and it's not what we are looking for here.  Instead,
your function should generate this:

    allPairs [1,2] [3,4] == [(1,3),(1,4),(2,3),(2,4)]

Here is another test case:

    allPairs [1..3] [6..8] == [(1,6),(1,7),(1,8),(2,6),(2,7),(2,8),(3,6),(3,7),(3,8)]
