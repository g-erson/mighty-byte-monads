title: Using the abstraction
---

Now your Set4.hs module has fairly decent set of abstract tools all built on the
Monad interface. Now go back through sets 1, 2, and 3 and redo them all using
the library of functions you built up in Set4.hs. This may seem like a waste of
time, but this will develop your familiarity with the names actually used by
Haskell's monad library. This is the core of developing a working knowledge of
monads. The first three sets were the motivation. Now we're getting to the real
world use.
