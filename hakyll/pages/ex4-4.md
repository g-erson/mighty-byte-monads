title: Creating Instances
---

Now you have a Monad type class with two functions: bind and return.  If
you've heard anything about monads in the past, this might sound familiar.
But don't go off and look at existing monad code yet.  You have a lot more
ground to discover yourself.

The next thing you need to do is create instances of your Monad type class for
the three types we've been working with: Gen, Maybe, and []. You can do this for
Maybe and [] with no trouble. But Gen won't work because it is a type alias.
First you need to replace your type alias with a newtype. Don't go back and
modify your old code. We'll be referring back to that in the future. Do this
work in a new file Set4.hs (again using the same header we've been using and
importing MCPrelude instead of Haskell's prelude). You can import Set2 because
that has your Maybe data type and associated code which can be reused. But don't
import Set1. When you are finished with this challenge you should have a Set4.hs
file with a Monad type class, a Gen newtype, and two instances.

If you did all the exercises properly this should be pretty straightforward. The
Monad instance for Gen may be a little bit less obvious because this time you'll
have to do some newtype wrangling.
